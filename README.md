# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the Pyber Analysis
After combining two datasets (city data and ride data), we are now able to analyze the ride-sharing data by grouping them to three city types (urban, suburban and city) and by date. This also enable visualization and provide readers an accessible way to understand the trend or pattern more easily.

## Analysis
The table below shows the ride-sharing data among different city types.

The below chart shows the total fares for each city type.

- Total Rides
    - The total number of rides of all city types is 2,375.
    - Most of the rides are under urban cities (1,625 out of 2,375), followed by suburban cities (625 out of 2,375) and rural cities (125 out of 2,375).

- Total Drivers
    - The total number of drivers of all city types is 2,973.
    - Majority of the drivers are in urban cities (2,405 out of 2,973), followed by suburban cities (490 out of 2,973).  Rural cities have the lowest number of total drivers among all city types (78 out of 2,973).

- Total Fares
    - The total fare of all city types is USD63,538.64.

- Average Fare per Ride
    - Out of the three cities types, the average fare per ride of rural cities is the highest (USD$34.62).  Followed by suburban cities where the average fare per ride is USD$30.97 and the average faire per ride for urban cities is the lowest (USD$24.53).

- Average Fare per Driver
    - The average fare per driver of rural cities (USD$55.49) is the highest among the city types, followed by suburban cities (USD$39.50) and urban cities ($16.57).
  
- Total Fares by City Type
    - The total fare of urban cities is USD$39,854.38, which is the highest among the city types.  The total fare of suburban cities is USD$19,356.33 and ranks the second. The total fare of rural cities is USD$4,327.93 and is the lowest.


## Summary
Recommendations to the CEO for addressing disparities among the city types:
-   The average fare per ride of rural cities is highest among the three city types and this might discourage riders.  Special discounts or promotions could be offered to potential riders in rural cities to incentivize them.  This will also help boost the total number of rides.
-   The number of total drivers in rural cities and suburban cities is far lower than urban cities and this could impact the fare for riders.  Recruiting more drivers in rural and suburban cities could help lower the average fare and encourage riders to take riders in those cities.
-   Disclosing the average fare per driver in different city types to the drivers might be able to divert drivers from urban cities to rural and suburban cities, which could be beneficial to the business, drivers and riders overall.
